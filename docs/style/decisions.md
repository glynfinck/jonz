# Design decisions

Every design pick, newest first. The PR that builds a pick adds its line
here and changes the rule it affects (see [README.md](README.md)). Options
pages are private artifacts on claude.ai.

| Date | Decision | Where | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-11-01 | House's pages on a laptop fill the room beside House's list, our own sections in columns (two at 1440, three at 1920); not names hanging left, one wide column or cards | this PR | [layout](layout.md#laptop-pages) |
