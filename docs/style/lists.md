# Lists and rows

## Rows

- **One `Row` everywhere:** a 32pt leading slot (tick box, avatar or icon),
  a one-line title, one meta line, one trailing item (a value, a status mark
  or a text button), 56 to 64pt tall with 48pt targets. A John is always a
  `JohnRow`. (Focus, #17)
- A Wall item is a `Row` with a sentence that names its John and an icon
  that says what happened (a flag for a flag), never just "flagged". (Wall
  items A, #55)

## Groups and spacing

- One inset `Group` per section; a 16pt gutter plus 16pt inset; 8 from a
  section label to its group; 32 between sections. All from `SPACE`, `GUTTER`,
  `INSET`, `LABEL_GAP` and `SECTION_GAP`, never a typed number. (Focus, #17)

## Order

- **Urgent first,** not the order the data arrives in: what needs you, then
  what's next, then the rest. (UI review, 25 Oct) *Backed by* NN/g on
  progressive disclosure, and Nielsen's "aesthetic and minimalist design".
- Finished things fold away (`DoneFold`: "Done (3)", with how many were
  late). (Focus, #17)
- One home per thing: a John, a person, a setting each have one page or
  sheet; other places link to it rather than repeat it. (Focus, #17; fair
  shares, 28 Oct)

## Long lists

- **Load as you scroll,** the same way everywhere (the Wall, History, the
  audit log, any list that grows), with one shared foot: how far back,
  Loading more, That's everything, Try again. "Show more" stays for the
  keyboard and short pages. On a laptop the foot is pinned full width along
  the bottom. (Long lists A, 31 Oct, #82) *Backed by* NN/g: endless lists
  suit feeds but need a reachable foot and a keyboard way in.
- Never fetch a whole table into the app. (Admin lists, 31 Oct)

## Admin lists

Built for very many rows from the start. (Admin lists, 31 Oct)

- No day headings; a time column instead.
- Search and filters run on the server, with indexes, and only the visible
  rows are drawn.
- **One search everywhere:** a single smart box, filters as tags. The empty
  box lists the page's filters (Who, What, When or the page's own) and recent
  searches, so nothing is hidden. Filters stay in the link. A count and
  Download, a "14 new" pill, and "Show more like this" on an entry. (Busy
  lists B, 31 Oct)
- Lists of things page by 50; timelines load as you scroll and have a When
  filter. (Owner admin, 30 Oct)

## Calendars and grids

- A month calendar shades days; tapping a day opens a sheet listing who.
  (Who's away F, #23)
- Today is an outlined whole day, never a filled circle or ring. (Who's
  away B, #23)
- A week-by-week grid for records over time (the Track record), with the
  breakdown one tap away. (Fair shares, 28 Oct, #35)

## Empty lists

Every list has a designed empty state: what will appear here, why it's
empty, and how to add the first one, with that action as its one button.
Never a blank group. (**New**) *Backed by* NN/g's guidance on empty states.
